**Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. - ([Hebrews 4:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:16&version=KJV))**

*Prayer is the core of the day. Take prayer out, and the day would collapse. — Amy Carmichael*

Let's pray:

• Lord, give us the confidence to come closer to the Throne of grace today.

• Lord, we completely depend on you during a time of need today.

• Father, help us grasp that we are without strength, and we would collapse without your presence with us today.
