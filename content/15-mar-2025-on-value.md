**29** Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will. **30** But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. **31** Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. ([Matthew 10:29-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010%3A29-31&version=NKJV))

*In every situation and every circumstance of your life, God is always doing a thousand different things that you cannot see and do not know. — John Piper*

&nbsp;Let's Pray:

• Lord we are grateful that you consider us so much more valuable than what we are;

• We are grateful that we are in the center of your will even when you are controlling the whole universe;

• We are privileged that we are in your thoughts as we move through the day.
