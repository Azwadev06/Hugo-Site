For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. ([**Romans 15:4**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2015%3A4&version=KJV))

As Christians, we have only one authority, one compass: the Word of God — Billy Graham

Let's Pray:

• Precious Father, we praise you for your Word that you have provided for us today.

• Lord thank you for your Word, which is a compass in our day-to-day life today.

• Marvelous God, we thank you for the hope that we have in the imminent coming of your Son.
