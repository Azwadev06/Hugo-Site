**Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. (1 Peter 1:3)**

*You can be born in a Christian home, but that doesn't make you a Christian. — Billy Graham*

Let's Pray:

- Lord, we praise You for the salvation You have provided through Your son.
- We are grateful for the living hope we have of Your imminent coming.
- We praise You for helping us realize that we belong to You.
