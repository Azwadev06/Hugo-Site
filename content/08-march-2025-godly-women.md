Be an **Esther**, bold and courageous enough to stand for the truth, to voice your opinion and fight for the good of others, even when it means to sacrifice yourself. If God has put you in a position, it is for a purpose. Never be afraid to heed to that inner voice.&nbsp;

Be a **Ruth**, loyal in all your relationships, walk the extra mile and don't quit when things get tough. Someday, you'll see why it was all worth the effort.&nbsp;

Be a **Lydia**, let your homes be open, let your hands be generous, let your hearts be big enough to help anyone in need. Joy is greatest when shared.&nbsp;

Be a **Hannah**, never cease to pray. It will never be in vain.&nbsp;

Be a **Mary**, humble and submissive to God. You don't have to be great for God to use you, you just need to obey.&nbsp;

Be a **Dorcas**, use your talents, however small it may seem to bring a smile on someone's face. You'll never know how much it can mean to someone.&nbsp;

Be an **Abigail**, remember how each decision can turn your life around for good or bad. Be wise.&nbsp;

Be an **Elizabeth**, never doubt what God can do. Miracles do happen.

Be a **Mary Magdalene**, never let your mistakes and judgments of other people stop you from experiencing true joy in Jesus.&nbsp;

Be a **Rebekah**, never forget that true beauty lies within. Draw people to God through your character.
