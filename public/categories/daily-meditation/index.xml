      <description>29 Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father&amp;rsquo;s will. 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. (Matthew 10:29-31)&#xA;In every situation and every circumstance of your life, God is always doing a thousand different things that you cannot see and do not know.</description>

      <description>7Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. 8For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. 9And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart… (Galatians 6:7-9)&#xA;My faith rests not in what I am or shall be, or feel, or know, but in what Christ is, in what he has done, and in what he is doing for me.</description>

      <description>Be an Esther, bold and courageous enough to stand for the truth, to voice your opinion and fight for the good of others, even when it means to sacrifice yourself. If God has put you in a position, it is for a purpose. Never be afraid to heed to that inner voice. Be a Ruth, loyal in all your relationships, walk the extra mile and don&amp;rsquo;t quit when things get tough.</description>
