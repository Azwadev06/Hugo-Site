      <description>Sunday School Families are the pillars of our society. We are here to come alongside you as parents in the joys and trials of raising young children and to be a partner in preaching the gospel to the youngest generation. Our vision is that kids participate in worship for the Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#xA;Sunday School begins at 11 AM during worship. Your children will be in a safe environment, with screened and trained teachers, where they will learn Biblical truth, sing songs, do activities, memorize scripture, and have a fun time doing it.</description>
