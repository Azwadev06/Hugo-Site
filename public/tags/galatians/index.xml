      <description>7Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. 8For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. 9And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart… (Galatians 6:7-9)&#xA;My faith rests not in what I am or shall be, or feel, or know, but in what Christ is, in what he has done, and in what he is doing for me.</description>
