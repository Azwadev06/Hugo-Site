      <description>The Methodist branch of the Protestant religion traces its roots back to 1739 when it developed in England as the result of a revival and reform movement begun by John Wesley and his brother Charles. Wesley&amp;rsquo;s three basic precepts that launched the Methodist tradition were:&#xA;Shun evil and avoid partaking in wicked deeds at all costs. Be kind to one and another as much as possible. Abide by the teachings of God the Almighty Father.</description>

      <description>Sunday School Families are the pillars of our society. We are here to come alongside you as parents in the joys and trials of raising young children and to be a partner in preaching the gospel to the youngest generation. Our vision is that kids participate in worship for the Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#xA;Sunday School begins at 11 AM during worship. Your children will be in a safe environment, with screened and trained teachers, where they will learn Biblical truth, sing songs, do activities, memorize scripture, and have a fun time doing it.</description>
